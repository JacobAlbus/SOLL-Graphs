The main file you should be concerned with is the "testing.py" file. There, you should be able to run the functions in the "graphing.py" file. 
You will need to change the lists for `greek_emails` and `american_emails` to fit the emails of the new batch of students. You will also need to change some of the file names.

Outside of the "testing.py" file, you'll need to update csv files inside the "survey-questions" directory to match with the questions of the new survey's. This is the most
tedious and possibly most confusing part so please email me if you have any questions. Also, make sure to not leave a hanging line at the end of the csv file.

Notes on File Names:
1. post_survey and pre_survey contain the survey data for the post course and pre course surveys, respectively.
2. pre_english_prof_test and pre_greek_prof_test contain the data for the pre-course proficiency test for English and Greek respectively.
